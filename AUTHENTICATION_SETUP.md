# Email Authentication Implementation - Complete

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Authentication Infrastructure
- **Supabase Auth Integration**: Email/password authentication with JWT tokens
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Three user roles - `admin`, `school`, `teacher`
- **Custom JWT Claims**: User roles and permissions embedded in access tokens
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level security policies based on user roles

### 2. Database Schema
- **User Profiles Table**: Stores user information and roles
- **Updated Students Table**: Added `user_id` column for ownership tracking
- **RLS Policies**: Role-based data access control
- **Auth Hooks**: Custom access token hook for JWT claims

### 3. Frontend Components
- **Login Page**: `/login` - Email/password authentication form
- **Auth Context**: React context for authentication state management
- **Protected Routes**: Middleware redirects unauthenticated users to login
- **Updated Navbar**: User profile display and sign-out functionality

### 4. Security Features
- **Middleware Protection**: All routes require authentication except `/login`
- **Session Management**: Automatic token refresh and session handling
- **Role-Based UI**: Different access levels based on user roles
- **Data Isolation**: Users can only access their own student records (except admins)

## 🔧 Setup Required

### Database Setup
1. Run the SQL script in Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```bash
   # Execute the contents of:
   scripts/setup-auth-schema.sql
   ```

2. Configure Supabase Dashboard:
   - Go to Authentication > Settings
   - Disable "Enable email confirmations" (optional)
   - Set "Site URL" to your domain
   - Add Custom Access Token Hook: `custom_access_token_hook`

3. Create Admin User:
   ```sql
   -- After creating a user through the dashboard:
   UPDATE user_profiles 
   SET role = 'admin', full_name = 'System Administrator'
   WHERE email = 'your-admin-email@example.com';
   ```

## 📋 User Roles & Permissions

### Teacher (Default)
- Create and manage their own student records
- View and edit students they created
- Cannot access other users' data

### School
- Same as Teacher permissions
- Can view all student records in the system
- Can edit all student records

### Admin
- Full system access
- Can manage all users and student records
- Can delete any records
- Can update user roles

## 🧪 Testing the Implementation

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

2. **Access the application**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Should redirect to `/login` if not authenticated

3. **Create users**: Use Supabase dashboard to create test users
   - Set different roles for testing
   - Test role-based access

4. **Verify functionality**:
   - Login/logout flow
   - Student record creation/editing
   - Role-based data visibility
   - Middleware protection

## 🔒 Security Notes

- **Public signup is disabled** - accounts must be created by administrators
- **JWT tokens contain role information** for client-side access control
- **RLS policies enforce server-side security** regardless of client behavior
- **Session management** handles token refresh automatically
- **Middleware protection** ensures all routes require authentication

## ✅ Implementation Status

**Status: Complete and Ready for Testing**

The email authentication system with RBAC is fully implemented and ready for use. Users need to run the database setup script and configure their Supabase dashboard settings to start using the authenticated system.

**Next Steps**:
1. Run database setup script
2. Configure Supabase dashboard
3. Create admin user
4. Test authentication flow
5. Create additional users with different roles
